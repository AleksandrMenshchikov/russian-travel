        According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
        but only 36% plan to hold vacation in your home country. Like, What
        have we not seen at home here? In fact, Russia is a whole universe
        with the gentle sea of ​​the south, dense forests Sayan and harsh ice
        plateau Putorana. And you can see all these beauties without millions
        in the account, a passport and hours of flight. Like, for example,
        Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took three children into an
        armful, set them to their "Lada" and traveled 20 thousand kilometers
        in their native country. We selected and described some interesting
        places worthy of your vacation.

            Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all,
            because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see
            slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if
            you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the
            invisible miracle of these places - the mountain air.
          </p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">
            The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in the
            summer. So you will see all the diversity of local flora and
            fauna. Elk roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges,
            and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls are also
            inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

            Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many also
            know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one of the
            most beautiful places in Russia.
          </p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">
            Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place
            for skiing competitions. This is such a sport when a skier ties
            himself to a motorcycle and the tandem tries to develop the
            highest possible speed on ice. In March 2019, the world record was
            set at the Baikal Mile festival - 197.011 km / h.

            sweeps 30 meters - the forests of Karelian national parks because
            of impassable swamps never knew an ax. Some pine trees are more
            than half a millennium old. Touch a living creature that saw the
            sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. In a virgin forest for a
            hundred kilometers you will not find trails. And on rare paths,
            trees a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear
            claws. So that everyone knows who the boss is here.
